1) Overreach: Several of my Democratic friends over the last several months have tried to comfort me when discussing the fall of the Republican Party with one consoling thought: Don't worry, we will screw it up. And on that one thing I agree with them. The liberal Democrats that currently run the Congress are destined to overreach on the legislative front. Pelosi and her California allies, like Reps.

Steven Carrigan of Salina, Kansas I served in the U.S. Marine corps. Did I eat MREs? You bet and a lot of them. They get the job done but always needed a bit of spicing up, Tabasco sauce that someone would bring to the field, usually. Cold weather affected them more than anything. Nothing worse than getting the beans and franks in cold weather. The beans would be semi-hard and the franks rock solid. The preservative that they are in gels up and looks like petroleum jelly. Had to carry them next to your body to get them warm. To me the worst one was the chicken ala king, disgusting. The desserts were always good. Some guys had recipes that you could mix together two or three MREs and have a pretty good meal if you had heat and the time to cook it. Even though I thought I left them behind when I left the military, I still have them in the car during the winter and when I do ice fishing. They are great in a pinch.

In third, Universal's horror prequel "The Thing" didn't scare up many ticket sales this weekend, opening with $8.7 million. The film, which totes a reported $35 million budget, performed below Universal's expectations, becoming the latest 2011 horror film to not connect with audiences. Movies like "Scream 4" ($38.2 million total), "The Rite" ($33 million), and "Priest" ($29.1 million) have all struggled at the box office this year. Even "Thing" star Mary Elizabeth Winstead's former franchise film, "Final Destination 5," performed unremarkably, earning only $42.1 million. The best comparison for "The Thing" is probably "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark," which opened with a similar $8.5 million and finished with $23.2 million. Considering "The Thing" earned a weak "B-" CinemaScore grade and a sad $2,990 per theater average, that total is about the best it can hope for.
