This is a guide to generate the files test.32k.en, test.32k.es and answers.en, used by mask-align to align the answers in spanish:

0) Get the newsqa.csv corpus file

1) To remove rows with unanswered questions, move to the directory scripts\generate-alignments and run :
    python remove_bad_rows.py

2) To generate test.en, test.es, answers-indexes.en.txt and answers.en.txt, run:
        python generate_files.py

3) Run the following commands (Google Sentencepiece must be installed):
       spm_encode --model=../en.model --output_format=piece < test.en > test.32k.en
       spm_encode --model=../es.model --output_format=piece < test.es > test.32k.es

4) Run:   python process_answer_indexes.py

5) Create a folder named corpus-es in the root directory, and copy the files test.32k.en, test.32k.es y answers.en

6) In the root directory, run mask-alig: bash thualign/bin/generate.sh -s spanish -o output.txt

7) The file output.txt has the answers marked in the spanish sentences with the characters "{{" and "}}". The file is tokenized, so we must decode it.

8) Decode output.txt:
    spm_decode --model=es.model --input_format=piece < output.txt > output-plain.txt

9) Run the script output-brackets-to-indexes.py in the folder where the file output-plain.txt is located 

The following three files are generated:
    - output-indexes.txt: It contains the indexes of the answers in spanish
    - output-answers.txt: It contains the answers in spanish (in plain text)
    - output-sentences.txt: It contains the sentences in spanish (untokenized)
